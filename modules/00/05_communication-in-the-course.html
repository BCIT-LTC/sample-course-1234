			<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
			<p>Please post any questions you might have about the course in the Questions and Answers (Q&amp;A) discussion forum. In this way, everyone can benefit from your questions and their answers. It’s also a good way for everyone to share their collective wisdom about anything in the course so feel free to answer the questions your fellow students have if you know the answer. You can contact the course instructor individually for personal questions.</p>
			<h2>Course Café</h2>
			<p>The Course Café is a social space for you to share interesting ideas or articles you come across during the course. Your instructor will not be monitoring this space.</p>
